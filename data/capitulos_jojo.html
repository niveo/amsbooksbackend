      <p class="calibre2">
        It's dark again. So it's evening. It's the third evening. No, I'm wrong.
        It's the fourth evening.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        It's... Tuesday... Wednesday... Thursday. Yes, it's Thursday. Why do I
        count the days? Why do I say it's Thursday? There aren't any more days.
        There's just time. Time when it's dark, and time when it's light.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Everything is dead, so why not days, too? Yes. No more days. No more
        Thursdays. There's only now.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">And there's only me. Why? Why aren't I dead, too?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        That's a stupid question, Jojo, I say to myself. You know why you aren't
        dead. You aren't dead because you weren't in the house. You were in the
        fields when the men came. But that's not my question. I want to know why
        I was in the fields. Why wasn't I in the house with my family?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        There are no answers to questions like that, Jojo, I tell myself. I have
        to talk to myself because there isn't anyone else. I think there are
        mice here. I can hear them at night. You can't talk to mice. But there
        aren't any other people. There's only me. Jojo.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I know this because I listen. I listen all day and all night. I hide in
        our stable, where the horse lived. And I hear nothing. Just the mice.
        The village is quiet. There is smoke now, but smoke is quiet. The fires
        were noisy, but the fires have stopped. It rained yesterday, and after
        the rain there were no more fires. Just smoke.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Of course, I'm not the only thing alive here. As well as the mice,
        there's a dog somewhere in the village. I can hear it. And there are
        rats and flies. But I think I'm the only person here. All the others are
        dead.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Everyone in the village is dead. There's only me now and I don't know
        what to do.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I'm not in our house. I went into our house after the men went away. So
        I saw my family. All of them on the floor. All the blood on the floor,
        too. They were all dead. My mother, my father, my sister, my brother. My
        family.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Jojo, don't think about that, I say to myself. Don't think about the
        blood. Don't think about those things. But I can't stop thinking about
        them. My mother had no clothes on. I've never seen my mother without
        clothes. Perhaps I will go into the house tomorrow and put some clothes
        on my mother. She must be cold without clothes. But I'm afraid that the
        men are going to come back.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Perhaps they are looking for me. Perhaps they will come back for me.
        Perhaps I want them to find me. Then I can be dead, too. I don't want to
        be the only one alive.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Come on, Jojo, I say to myself. You are the man of the family now. You
        must be a big boy. You must be strong.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        It's difficult to be strong when you're ten. And I'm only just ten. My
        birthday was last month. In July.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I got a bicycle for my birthday. It was white. It was a wonderful
        bicycle. I cycled to school on it every day.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        There isn't a school here any more. There was a big fire there and now
        there's just smoke. I don't know where my bicycle is. But I don't want
        it any more.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I don't understand why the men came to our village. It's not a very rich
        village. We don't have very much. We're not like the people in the big
        towns. My brother went to live in the town. He told us about the cars
        and the shops and all the things there.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Why didn't my brother stay in the town? Why did he come back here? Why
        did he die? He was always laughing. He was always so nice to everyone.
        He wanted to be a teacher. He went to the town to study. My father said
        that my brother was a good son. He worked hard. He wasn't going to be a
        poor farmer like my father. I said I was going to study hard, too, and
        my father laughed. His big laugh. The laugh that made his tummy go up
        and down. 'I like that,' he said. 'That's good. I'll have two sons to
        look after me when I'm old.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'I'm going to study too,' said my sister.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'Just find a rich husband,' said my father.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I don't want a rich husband,' my sister told me. 'I'm going to be a
        teacher like our brother. You see, Jojo, our father doesn't know, but
        there are lots of women teachers in the town. Our brother told me.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        But my sister can't be a teacher now. She's dead on the floor. There was
        blood on her legs. I pulled down her skirt. It wasn't nice like that. My
        sister was always very nice. She was kind, too. Why did the men hurt
        her? She never hurt anyone.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Sometimes I want to die now, too. But sometimes I don't. I don't want to
        die.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I sit at the back of the stable. The stable is where our horse slept at
        night. But the men took away all the horses. I heard them. I'm happy
        that our horse is alive. She was a good horse. I gave her nuts. She
        liked eating nuts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I'm very hungry, but I don't want to look for food. I'm afraid one of
        the men will come back and see me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I'll stay here and be very quiet. Then no one will find me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        It's dark now. I can hear the mice. Or perhaps they're rats. I'm not
        afraid of them. They are probably hungry. I'm so hungry I can't sleep.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Don't think about food. Think about something else. Then I'll forget how
        hungry I am. Perhaps I'll talk to my mother. Or my brother or my sister.
        I like to think about them. Perhaps that's why I'm alive. So one day I
        can tell people about them. I'm Jojo, I'll say. I'm alone now, but once
        I had a family.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        My grandmother said that when people die, they go away very slowly.
        After they die, they stay in the air so you can say goodbye to them.
        'You mustn't be afraid of ghosts,' she told me. 'Ghosts are good. You
        can talk to them and they will help you.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I think that there are lots of ghosts here. I think that my grandmother
        was right.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I'm going to tell them that I'm here. This is Jojo, I'll say. I'm not
        dead and I won't let the men find me. I'll stay here and I'll talk to
        you so you won't feel so sad.
      </p>

    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">Maybe the ghosts will help me.</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        There's a sound outside the stable. There's something there. Something
        bigger than a mouse. I don't know what it is. And now I can hear another
        sound. A bigger sound, like a lorry. It is a lorry. A lorry is coming
        here to the village. The men are coming here.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">I'll be very quiet. Perhaps they won't find me.</p>

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The sound outside the stable door changes and I know what it is.
        Cluck... cluck... cluck... cluck. It's my chicken, Whitetail. Whitetail
        is my favourite chicken. She gives us lots of eggs. 'We're never going
        to eat her,' my father once told me. He understood that Whitetail was my
        chicken.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I call to Whitetail and she answers me. She comes into the stable, but
        she's very afraid. Maybe the men tried to kill her. I take her in my
        arms and talk to her.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I'm very hungry,' I tell Whitetail, 'but I can't go and look for your
        eggs because the men are coming. I have to be careful. I don't want
        anyone to find me.' As I talk to her, I hear another sound, the sound of
        the lorry. It's getting nearer.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I'm afraid that the men will find Whitetail. Perhaps they will find me,
        too. And then they will kill both of us. 'You're afraid and I'm afraid,
        too,' I tell her. She doesn't move in my arms, but I feel a bit better
        now she's with me. She's happier now, too. She's quiet in my arms.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The sound of the lorry gets very loud. The men are here, outside our
        farm. I listen and wait.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I can hear lots of voices, but they sound different. They don't sound
        like the men in our village and they don't sound like the men who live
        across the river.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I look out through a hole in the wall and I see the men. They aren't the
        men from across the river. They are soldiers, and they look different.
        Their clothes and their boots look new, and some of them have red hair.
        One of them goes into our house. I see him coming out again. He is being
        sick on the ground. Another older soldier speaks to him. He puts his arm
        around him. I don't understand what he says, but I think he is nice to
        the young soldier.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I think that maybe these are not bad men. But I don't know who they are.
        They have strange voices. I must be careful.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        They are looking everywhere. I try to hide in a dark bit of the stable.
        There is no door because of the fire.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        A soldier comes in. He is not old. A little bit older than my brother, I
        think. He is the young soldier who was sick. Then Whitetail begins to
        cluck again. The soldier shouts something, but I don't understand. He
        has a gun. I can't stop Whitetail moving and clucking. I put her down
        and she runs to the soldier.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        He begins to laugh. Whitetail runs out of the stable and the soldier
        runs after her.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">They're going to kill her, I think.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'No!' I shout. I run out of the stable. 'Don't kill her! She's my
        chicken!'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers all look at me. I try to move again, but I can't. I haven't
        eaten anything for days. I fall down.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        A soldier picks me up. Now they are going to kill me, I think. But he
        doesn't look angry. He looks very sad.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        He shouts something. Nothing happens. The men are all looking at my
        house. And then I see another man. He was in my house and now he comes
        across to me. He doesn't look like the soldiers. He's tall with yellow
        hair. He has two big cameras. My brother had a camera, but it was very
        small.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The man smiles at me as he walks. He opens his hands to show that he has
        nothing in them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Don't be afraid,' he says. He speaks our language, but he speaks it
        rather strangely. 'You're safe now,' he says. 'These soldiers won't hurt
        you.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Where's my chicken?' I ask. 'I don't want the soldiers to hurt my
        chicken.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The man says something to the soldiers in their language. They laugh and
        then the young soldier who came into the stable comes to me. Whitetail
        is in his arms and the soldier gives her to me. The soldier says
        something and smiles.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The man with the cameras tells me that the soldier comes from a village
        like mine. His father is a farmer and he has lots of chickens and ducks.
        But his village is a long way from here.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'What's your name?' the man asks me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Jojo,' I tell him. And I tell him that I'm the only one here in the
        village. He says my words in the other language. He tells me that this
        is translating. He will tell the soldiers anything that I want to tell
        them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I don't want to tell them anything, but the man says that they are here
        to help.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Are you hurt?' asks the man with the cameras. He tells me to call him
        Chris. I tell Chris that I'm not hurt. I was in the fields when the men
        came.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers smile at me. They have brown and green clothes, but their
        hats are blue. It's like a bit of the sky on the top of their heads.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">'Are you hungry?' asks Chris.</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'Yes,' I say, 'I'm very hungry.'</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers make a small fire for cooking. I can hear it. It's a good
        sound. The fire in the village was different. It made a sound like the
        wind at night. A great big wind that makes you hide in your bed with the
        blanket over your head.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers give me some rice and beans. It's very good. 'Don't eat it
        too fast or your tummy will hurt,' says Chris. My mother often said
        that. I want to cry, but I can't. The tears are all inside my head like
        a big ball of rice that won't go down.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers have lots of blankets in the lorry. Chris takes one and
        puts it over me. I sit down and Whitetail sits down next to me. The
        young soldier has given Whitetail some food, too. He tells me that his
        friends call him Duck now, because he has chickens and ducks at home. He
        smiles at me. I want to smile, but I don't have any smiles any more. The
        men took them away with them across the river.

    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I can't feel the ghosts of my family any more. Perhaps they are inside

    <div class="s2">

      <p class="calibre2">
        I don't know where I'm going, but Chris tells me it's a long way away
        from the village. He says that I'm going to a place where there are lots
        of children like me. He says that there has been fighting in other
        places. And there are lots of children without families. But I have a
        family. They're here. The soldiers don't understand that. Chris doesn't
        understand. Only the ghosts understand.

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers say that they need to bury all the people in the village.
        This is good. It's not good for dead people to be inside the houses.
        'The earth is kind to the dead,' my grandmother always said. 'You must
        give the dead to the earth.' The soldiers understand this.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'The soldiers need to know the names of the people,' says Chris. 'We
        need to know who we are burying. Do you know who they are, Jojo?'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Of course I know,' I say. 'Everyone in the village knows everyone
        else.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Chris tells me that he is a photographer and a writer.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">'Why are you here?' I ask him.</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Why?' Chris asks. He looks around my village. Or what was my village.
        'Because of this,' he says. 'Because men and women and children are
        dying in your country, and it's important that people outside your
        country know these things.' He speaks very quietly as if he is talking
        to himself. 'I take photos because the dead have no one else to speak
        for them.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I understand this. In our village my grandmother always told the stories
        of the dead. And after she died, the teacher told her story. Now, there
        is only me here. So Chris is going to tell their stories.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Chris talks to me. He tells me that he comes from a country called
        England. It's a long way from here. He looks tired. His clothes look
        tired, too. Maybe he sleeps in his clothes. Chris has a face like tired
        clothes. Maybe he's travelled a long way.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        After I've eaten, I feel stronger. I can stand up. Chris takes me over
        to talk to the soldiers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'You must bury everyone in the field of the families,' I tell the
        soldiers. 'This is where all the families are together. It's very
        important that the dead sleep with their families.' The soldiers
        understand. They have families at home, they say.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers take my family out of the house and I don't want to look,
        but I do look. The soldiers have put blankets over the bodies. There is
        no more blood. The soldiers speak very quietly. They don't want to wake
        up my family. They understand that you have to talk quietly when you are
        talking to ghosts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I tell Chris the names of all the people in the village and he writes
        down their names. Then we go into the field of the families.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        We walk round the village. I know all the people in the village. I don't
        know anything outside the village, and I'm afraid of the world outside.
        But I don't tell anyone.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I tell the soldiers the names of the people in each house. Then they
        bring out the bodies.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        We go first to the big house. The most important man in the village
        lived here. He had many cows, as well as goats and chickens. There is
        nothing here now. All his family are dead. His daughter is dead. She was
        at school with me. I liked her, she was very funny. She liked drawing.
        She sometimes drew pictures of the teacher in class.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Now she is a body under a blanket. Next to her is her brother. He was a
        bit older than me. He went to school, too, and he helped in the fields.
        He milked the goats in the mornings and evenings, and worked with his
        father on Saturdays and Sundays.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        All my friends. All my cousins and aunts and uncles. All the people I
        talked to every day. The man with a funny walk, who lived by himself
        near the river; the woman who gave all the children sweets; our teacher,
        my family. They aren't here any more. There are only bodies under
        blankets.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        When we go to the teacher's house, we hear sounds. It's the teacher's
        dog, inside the house. Chris goes into the house and then he comes out.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'The dog isn't hurt,' Chris tells me, 'but he's afraid and very hungry.
        I can't go near him. Do you know him, Jojo? Does he have a name?'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I know him,' I say. 'But he doesn't have a name. The teacher just
        called him Dog.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'The dog's afraid, but he needs some food and water,' Chris tells me. 'I
        think that I smell strange to the dog. Perhaps your smell won't be so
        strange, Jojo. Can you take the dog some food and water?'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I don't know why they don't just kill the dog. He doesn't have a job to
        do here any more.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Why don't the soldiers shoot the dog?' I ask Chris.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'They don't want to,' says Chris. 'In my country we love animals. We
        don't like to hurt them.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I think I know why they don't want to kill the dog. There are too many
        bodies here already.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers have food in little boxes. They open a box and give it to
        me and I take it inside the teacher's house.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The teacher's body has gone, but there's blood on the floor. The smell
        of the blood is making the dog very afraid.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Hello, Dog,' I say. 'It's me, Jojo.' Dog is very angry. He wants to
        hurt me. I put the food on the ground and push it to him. Dog eats it
        very quickly and drinks the water and I talk to him. After a while, he
        is quieter. And then I take him outside. He's very happy to be outside
        and he runs around. He's a nice dog. He's not at all dangerous.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Chris takes photos of me and Dog. He takes photos very quickly. When my
        brother took photos, he told me not to move. But Chris takes photos when
        I am moving. His camera makes a funny click click sound.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers all like Dog. They give him chocolate. And they give me
        chocolate, too.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers and I go to my school. The fire was very big here. There is
        no school building here any more. But there are also no bodies. The
        school was closed when the men came.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers find two books on the floor. They have a few pages which
        aren't burnt. They give the books to me. The fire has eaten the village.
        There is nothing here now. Only me and Dog and Whitetail and two books
        with black pages.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">I show Chris the books and he looks very sad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'My children read books like that,' he tells me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers go into the field of the families. They make holes and bury
        the people from my village. Then they write their names on bits of wood
        and push the bits of wood into the earth, too. I go into the field with
        them. I want to talk to my grandmother.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Hello, grandmother,' I say. 'This is Jojo. I've brought you the family.
        I know you'll be happy to see them again. I'm not coming with them. But
        I want to be with them, grandmother. I'm all alone here. Well, not
        really alone. There are lots of soldiers. They don't speak our language,
        so they can't talk to you. They're nice to me, but they say they're
        going to take me away. I don't want to leave you, grandmother, but I
        know I have to go. So I'm here to say goodbye.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Above the field I can see big birds in the sky. They are bad birds.
        Birds that don't sing. The birds that sing have all gone.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I am talking quietly to my grandmother when I hear sounds. They are a
        long way away, but I know what they are. Guns.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Some of the men who came across the river had guns. I could hear the
        sound of the guns in the field. They were very loud. When they stopped,
        I could hear them in my head. These guns make a bigger sound. They're a
        long way away, but I can hear them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers are listening, too. They say that we must leave now. The
        fighting is getting nearer.

      <p class="calibre2">
        I didn't know about the fighting. All I knew was the village and the
        things my brother told me about the big town. No one told me about
        fighting. There are so many things that I don't know. Right now, I don't
        know where I'm going. I only know that I'm leaving my village.

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Chris has a jeep and he says that he will drive me to the Children's
        House. I know it's a jeep because my uncle had a jeep once. Chris's jeep
        is very dirty. That's because the earth roads are wet now.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I get into the jeep with Chris and we follow the soldiers out of our
        village. I am leaving my home. I am leaving everything I know.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I'm thirsty and Chris gives me water from a strange flat bottle. It's
        got a kind of coat on it. Chris says that it's a soldier's water bottle
        and it's like that to keep the water cold.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        It's good water. There are no flies in it and it's not green like the
        water from the river.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'Why do people fight?' I ask Chris.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I don't know,' says Chris. He sounds very tired. 'I don't know why men
        fight each other. All I do is take photos and tell stories.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I love stories. My grandmother often told me stories about our family
        and what happened a long, long time ago. I tell Chris this.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I don't write stories like that,' says Chris. 'I write stories about
        things that are happening now. I write for a newspaper in England. I
        tell people a long way away about people like you,' he says.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'About me?' I ask. 'Are you going to tell my story?'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'Maybe,' says Chris. 'Is that OK?'</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">I think about it.</p></div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">'Yes,' I decide. 'That's OK.'</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'My newspaper likes stories about children,' Chris says. He sounds

    </div>

      <p class="calibre2">'Tell me about your family,' says Chris.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        So I tell Chris about my family. I can do that. But I can't talk about
        the men. There are no words for that. The words don't want to come out.
        I will never tell anyone about those things.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I tell Chris about my parents and about my brother and sister. I want
        people to know about my family. Chris says he will tell people all about
        them. He'll tell them about how my father worried about the rain. He'll
        tell them how my sister wanted to be a teacher like my brother, and
        he'll tell them about me and my white bicycle.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I tell him how my mother looked after the house. 'After the fire, a lot
        of the house fell down. I told my mother all about it,' I say to Chris.

    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'You told your mother?' he asks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Yes. I talked to her ghost. You know that, after they die, people go
        away very slowly. I don't know a lot about ghosts,' I tell Chris. 'Only
        what my grandmother told me. She said that you can't see them and you
        can't hear them, but you know that they're there.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I think that your grandmother was right,' says Chris. 'When you go to a

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I'm happy that Chris understands. I like Chris. He is my new friend. I
        think he understands. He says that he often comes to my country. He
        likes it very much. I tell Chris that I'm worried about my house.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I'm not there now,' I tell him. 'Perhaps all the walls will fall down.

    <div class="s2">

      <p class="calibre2">

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'But we also had walls outside, all the way round the farm,' I tell
        Chris. 'You saw them. When I was small, I walked round them and thought
        that these were walls but there wasn't a roof. So I asked my mother why
        there were walls all round the farm and no roof.'
      </p>

        'She told me that the walls showed that it was our house. We had walls
        to stop other people from coming in. But I thought, why did we want to
        stop people from coming in? I didn't understand then, you see. Lots of
        people came into our house. My father's friends often came in and they
        drank and laughed together. I heard them when I woke up in the night.
        And in the morning my father had a headache and we all walked very
        quietly.'

        'My brother had friends in the house, too,' I tell Chris. 'Sometimes
        people came to buy animals and to sell them. And the doctor from the
        next village came into our house once when I hurt my head. So I thought
        and thought. And then I asked my mother about it again.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'She told me that there were other people in the world. People who
        weren't nice. She told me that there were people on the other side of
        the river. They didn't like us and they didn't want us to live on our
        farms. So we had walls. And my mother told me that the river was our
        wall, too. It was so big, no one could cross it. So we were safe. I
        didn't understand then. I thought, how can a river be like a wall? But I
        understand now. And my mother was wrong. I thought that she knew all the
        answers, but she didn't. She didn't know that the people could cross the
        river. She thought that we were safe. And when the people came from the
        other side of the river, the walls didn't stop them. The river didn't
        stop them.'

        Chris is quiet. We're going slowly along the road. The road is very bad

        We're driving past a village and I can see that there has been a fire
        here, too. It's all black and it smells like our village. It's a very
        bad smell. We drive slowly, but we see nobody. It's another village of
        ghosts.

        This is what a dead village smells like, I think. We drive through
        slowly. There are black birds in the sky here, too. They know that there
        are bodies here. They want to eat the bodies. Once, one of our cows died
        in the night. In the morning these birds came and started to eat the
        cow. They can smell it. The village smells worse than a dead cow.
        Perhaps all my country smells like this now.

        I can see the river through the trees. We are driving along by the
        river. I like the river. It's a very big river and it goes very fast. I
        often walked along it with my brother. He said that you can't swim in
        it. And if you fall in the river, in two hours you'll be in another
        country. He told me not to forget that.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I could see how fast it was. I put a piece of wood in the river once and
        whoosh it was gone. I ran along the side of the river, but the piece of
        wood was faster than me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        It was always quiet near the river. There were trees which looked as if
        they were talking to the water. The river was a lot of different
        colours. When it rained, the river was green and grey and silver like
        the fish that swam in it. On sunny days the river had lots of little
        gold bits in it. They danced on top of the water as if they were happy
        that it was a sunny day.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Last month my father and I walked along the river. There was a farmer he
        wanted to see in another village, and he said that because it was the
        school holidays, I could go with him. I was very happy. I liked going
        for walks with my father.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        My father often talked to me on these walks. He told me what he was
        thinking. 'It's too dry,' he said. Or, 'It's too wet.' It was nearly
        always too dry or too wet. There was always too much rain or not enough
        rain. When there was too much rain, there were lots of weeds in the
        fields. My father told me that weeds were green plants that were in the
        wrong place. They made my father angry. He hated the weeds. And I hated
        the weeds because it was my job to go into the fields after school and
        pull them out of the ground.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        When there was not enough rain, the fields went yellow and then brown
        and the ground was hard like the walls of our house. Then all the plants
        died.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        My father and I walked along the river to a place where there were lots
        of stones.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'There was a farm here once,' said my father.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">'What happened?' I asked him.</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'The people from across the river came,' my father told me. 'They took
        all the animals and then made a big fire. And now there's nothing. Just
        stones and weeds.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'What about the people?' I asked my father. He didn't tell me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I know now why he didn't tell me. It was because the people on that
        other farm were dead. My father didn't want me to know things like that.
        I can understand that now. Because I know what happens when the men
        come.

        'There's the river,' I say to Chris as we see it again through the
        trees. It looks different here. It's the same river as the river near my
        village, but it's not the same. I think of my mother's face after the
        men came. It was the same but not the same. I don't want to think about
        that.

        There are so many children here. They come from many villages and all of

        Doctor Nicky shows me round the Children's House. But it isn't just one
        house. There are many houses where people sleep and eat. And there's a
        big hospital for all the children who are hurt. There are lots of
        children here who are hurt. The house where I sleep is bigger than any
        house in my village. We all sleep in one big long room.

      <p class="calibre2">
        Days go by and other children come here. We all do lessons together and
        we play football. Dog likes football, too, but he always tries to eat
        the ball. It makes the small children laugh. The very small children are
        happy here because they don't understand what is happening in our
        country. All the other children are unhappy. I know that because they
        shout and cry in the night. No-one sleeps quietly here.

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Doctor Nicky is the doctor here. She speaks our language very well and
        is very nice. She wears a white T-shirt with letters on it. 'What are
        the letters for?' I ask her.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'The letters are for "Medecins Sans Frontieres". That means "Doctors

      <p class="calibre2">
        'Is that where you come from?' I ask. I know that some countries are

    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'A land without borders is a good place,' I tell her. 'You can be safe

        I like Doctor Nicky. She has lots of children to look after, but she

        There is one boy here who says nothing. No one knows his name or where

        Well, I do want to talk to Red because Doctor Nicky wants me to. But I

        the things that are in his head. I think he's seen some very bad things.
        I think perhaps he was in his house when the men came.

    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I go outside and Dog follows me. Red isn't afraid of Dog, but he's
        afraid of people.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I sit outside and talk to Red. I talk about my family, tell him stories.
        I tell him a story about when my mother had a new dress and how it got
        wet in the rain. She put it near the fire to dry and a bit of wood fell
        out of the fire and burned it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Then I tell Red a story about the time my brother went into the fields
        with the goats, but he started to read a book and the goats ran away.

    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">'I had a goat,' Red says.</p></div>

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Our goats all had names,' I tell him. But then I stop. I don't want to
        think about our goats. The men took them away.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'My goat was...' Red begins. But he never says what his goat was. He
        never says any other words. Only those words about the goat.

    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">I run to Doctor Nicky.</p></div>

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        But it wasn't. It was the end. The next day Red walked out of the
        Children's House. He walked down the road, between the trees. Maybe he
        wanted to go home. Maybe he just wanted to go away. I don't know. But I
        never saw him again.
      </p>

    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        After he left, Doctor Nicky looked very sad. But then she went back

    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Some of the children here say that Red stepped on a landmine after he
        left the Children's House. There are lots of children here who have
        stepped on landmines. Most of them don't have any legs. Men have put
        landmines into fields and under the roads. All the places that children
        go.

      <p class="calibre2">
        I didn't know about landmines, but the other children tell me about
        them. Landmines sit in the ground and when you stand on them - bang! You
        die or you get very badly hurt. Often you lose your legs.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Doctor Nicky says that there are thousands and thousands of landmines in
        our country. When the fighting stops, there will be landmines there. So
        children will be hurt.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I think about this at night. I also think that the fighting is getting
        closer. You can hear the guns and also bombs. They're louder than the
        guns.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        At night I think of my home. It's a very long way away. I'm afraid of
        the bombs and the guns and the sounds they make. I don't want the
        fighting to come here. I want Chris to be here. I feel safe with him.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">Â </p></div>
    <div class="s3"><p class="calibre2">CHAPTER SEVEN</p></div>
    <div class="s1"><p class="calibre2">Chris</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Chris is here again. He came early this morning. He was wearing the same
        clothes and looked very dirty. But one of the women here has washed his
        clothes and now he looks clean again. Chris takes lots of photos of all
        of us in the Children's House and in the hospital.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers are here again, too. They don't live at the Children's
        House, but some of them come and play football with us. Duck likes
        playing football. He says that he often plays football at home.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Duck tells me that he and the other soldiers come from a place called
        Ireland. It's near England and it's very green. There are lots of
        fields, and lots of chickens and ducks. He says that all the soldiers
        call him Duck now. And it's all because of Whitetail and me. Whitetail
        likes Duck. Duck picks her up and she clucks very happily.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        When the other soldiers are here with Duck, they sometimes laugh at him.
        They shout Duck's name and then they all laugh.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Chris tells me that 'duck' means two things in English. One is the bird
        that lives in the water. The other is when you get down on the ground,
        when someone shoots a gun at you. So the soldiers shout, 'Duck!' and
        fall on the ground. And then they laugh.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        They play games, like me and my brother. I didn't know that soldiers
        were like this.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Are the soldiers going to fight the bad men across the river?' I ask
        Chris.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'No,' says Chris. 'They aren't here to fight. They have come here to try
        and make the country safe,' says Chris. 'They are United Nations
        soldiers. They will fight only if someone tries to hurt them. The
        soldiers come from different countries and they go to other countries to
        stop people fighting.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I don't understand. Chris says that the United Nations means that lots
        of countries get together, like my father did with the other men in the
        village. They decide all the things that are good and bad and what the
        other countries have to do. If the other countries don't do them, then
        they send their soldiers. He says that the United Nations is called the
        UN. That's what is written on the side of their lorries.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'But the fighting will stop if the soldiers kill the bad men,' I say.
        'Then everything will be better.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'It's not as easy as that, Jojo,' says Chris.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Why didn't the soldiers come here before?' I ask Chris. 'Why didn't
        they come here when the bad men first crossed the river? Before my
        family died? Before the fires?' I think I don't like the soldiers so
        much now.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'It takes a long time to get the soldiers ready,' says Chris. 'And it's
        never easy to send men a long way. The important thing now is to stop
        the fighting. There are villages like yours on the other side of the
        river, too. And children.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">But I don't believe him.</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Chris comes and talks to me every day now. He's teaching me to speak
        English. He says I'm very intelligent.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'What lessons do you like at school?' Chris asks me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I like reading,' I answer. 'I'm reading the two books the soldiers
        found in my old school. They're a bit black from the fire, but you can
        read some of the pages. When I build a new school for the village, I'll
        use these books,' I tell Chris.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'When you build your new school, I'll get new books for you,' says
        Chris. 'I'll ask the people who read our newspaper to give money for the
        books and for the school.' But Chris looks sad and I know what he is
        thinking.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        He thinks I am a child and I don't understand, but I do understand. He
        thinks that there is no one back in the village, so there will never be
        a school there again.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'There are people from the village who live in the big town,' I tell
        Chris. 'They'll come back with their children one day and we'll build
        the village again.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I remember all the sounds of the village. People laughing and working
        and talking. The people must go back. I must go back.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        When you leave your village, it's like walking into a big hole. You fall
        and you don't stop falling. And if the village is empty, who will talk
        to the ghosts?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        There are many empty villages in my country. And many ghosts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The soldiers have made a big hole in the ground and Doctor Nicky makes
        us hide in it when the sound of the bombs is very loud. All the small
        children cry.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I want to leave here. I want to go somewhere where there are no bombs
        and no men with guns.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Chris has been here for two weeks and now he says that he is going away.
        Not just to another village, but back to England. He comes to say
        goodbye to me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Please take me home with you to Oxford,' I ask him. 'I don't mind if
        you're not there all the time. I'll study and then I'll make money. I'll
        make lots of money and come back and build my village again.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I'm sorry, Jojo,' says Chris. 'But I can't take you back to England.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">'Why not? I'm very small. I don't eat very much.'</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'It's not that. This is your country. This is where you live. I
        can't...' He turns away from me. 'I will try and come back soon,' he
        says. 'And I will write to you, Jojo.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">And he goes.</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I don't want his letters. I want him to take me away. I don't like it
        here any more.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2"><p class="calibre2">Â </p></div>
    <div class="s3"><p class="calibre2">CHAPTER EIGHT</p></div>
    <div class="s1"><p class="calibre2">I knew your brother</p></div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        It's two weeks since Chris went away. The fighting is getting nearer. We
        hear the guns every day now.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        And there are planes in the sky. They go round and round like the black
        birds above my village. When the planes come, we all get into the hole
        in the ground. Everyone is afraid of the planes. They have bombs. Doctor
        Nicky says that the roof of our house is white with a big red cross.
        That shows the men in the planes that this is a hospital.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        But three days ago a bomb fell into the trees near the house where all
        the clothes are washed. Now it's not safe to go inside there and the
        women have to wash the clothes outside.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Doctor Nicky is angry. Many of the children can't go anywhere because
        they are too sick.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Every day, when the planes come, we have to hide in the hole. It's very
        hot there and my head hurts with the sound of the guns and the small
        children crying.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The sound of the guns goes on all night. It's like the sound of all the
        trees falling down. It makes my ears hurt. It makes my head hurt. Then,
        very early this morning, the guns stopped. We went back to our beds and
        went to sleep.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Today when I wake up, there are lots of men here. They are our soldiers.
        They look very tired. Some of them don't have any boots and they don't
        have very much food. They take some of the food that the UN soldiers
        gave us.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        The older boys are very noisy. They talk to the soldiers. Then the
        soldiers come and talk to all of us. They tell us that we must get
        bigger quickly, so that we can be soldiers like them and fight for our
        country.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">One of the soldiers comes up to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'I think I know you,' he says. 'Aren't you Jojo, the brother of - ?' And
        he says my brother's name.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'Yes,' I tell him. I know who he is now. He was a friend of my brother's
        and he came to our village and stayed with us.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I'm very happy to see him. He knows my village and when he talks to me,
        he talks to me as Jojo who lived in the village. With him, I am Jojo who
        had a brother.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I understand now why I feel so strange in the Children's House. It's
        because here I am not really Jojo. When I left my village, I left some
        of myself there. I was like a snake. I didn't have my old skin, and I
        didn't have a new skin.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        My brother's friend asks about my brother. I tell him. I tell him that I
        am the only one left from our village. He is very angry. My brother was
        a good friend of his. He wants to kill the men who killed my brother.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        We talk. He tells me what our soldiers are doing. And now, talking to my
        brother's friend, I feel that I am someone again. I am Jojo and I have a
        country. A country feels like a new skin.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        We talk about his village, too. He says that it is like my village, but
        it's a long way from here and there isn't any fighting. He says that he
        will take me there after the fighting is finished. He says that his
        family are very nice. They will be kind to me. They knew my brother,
        too.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I like him. He says that he and the other soldiers have walked for two
        days without stopping. They are very tired. After we talk, he sleeps on
        the ground. I look at his boots. They have holes in them. His gun is
        old, too. It's a small gun. It's not like the big new guns the UN
        soldiers have. They have new boots, too. And they aren't fighting.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Outside the Children's House, some of the UN soldiers are playing
        football with the older boys. I see Duck and he smiles at me. Dog is
        trying to play football, too. I sit and watch them for a while. Dog runs
        after the ball and catches it in his mouth. Then he runs away. Everyone
        runs after him.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I am sitting by the wall and Duck's gun and boots are next to me. There
        is no one here to see me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        Very quickly, I pick up the big gun and the boots. They're very heavy. I
        take them to my brother's friend and wake him up.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        My brother's friend is very happy when I give him the gun and the boots.
        He gives me his old gun because he says that I will need it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        He says that our soldiers are going to hide in the hills and I can go
        with him.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        'You can't stay here now, Jojo,' he says. 'They'll be looking for you
        when they find that the gun has gone.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I take his old gun. It's not very heavy. I follow him, my brother's
        friend. He talks to one of the other soldiers who came with him and then
        he goes through the house and out of the door at the back. There are
        trees near there and very soon no one can see us.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="s2">
      <p class="calibre2">
        I think of Chris as I go. His letters will go to the Children's House,

    <div class="s2">
